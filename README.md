# web-scraper

### Project Motivation

I have to get an oil change on my car every so often, and I always go to the same dealership. However, they don't always have the best deal, but they will match prices from competing dealerships.

So instead of searching google for other dealerships in the area, and going to each website to see their "Service Specials" let's have python scrape the websites and email back the information.

### Current Project Roadmap

* Get the web-scrapper working again
* Get email working to email the results
* Dockerize the app to live in there

### Future Project Roadmap
* TBD
